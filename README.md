# iEDC NSSCE Website in NodeJS app
## iEDC Website rebuild from php to NodeJS with MongoDB
The real website is at [edc website](https://edc.nssce.ac.in)
### Read available comments in the page carefully while development
*Many dependencies have been installed nodemon,multer(file upload),nodemailer,email-templates being some important ones. The app itself has many routes and also has an authenticated login system with a database access. The template engine is Express Handlebars many conditional statements used inside hbs template(which could've done in the backend itself but it created page duplication for different kinds of users), that involves hiding(not really,but not showing even in developer browser) of many parts of the page.*
## Steps for Running the project
### Clone the project
### Navigate to the cloned location
```
cd Nodejs/
npm install
npm start
```
### This will do the magic
*If above doesn't work turn on your internet connection and try since there are many web CDNs that need network connection to fetch data*
### Also try 
```
npm run dev
```
